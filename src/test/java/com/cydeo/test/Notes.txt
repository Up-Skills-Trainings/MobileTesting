First Live Review Session Before Watching Recordings

Notes for Today's Live Lesson:
       * Mobile Testing : UI/FrontEnd Testing same as Selenium WebApp Testing
       * Which tool : Appium, a wrapper for Selenium API, so that we can execute automated test cases for Native, Hybrid and WebAPP for mobile devices
       * Appium is famous because it is used for both Android and IOS devices

THings to remember while watching Installation and Lesson videos
    * We have instructions as PDF file and Videos for both Windows and MACOS
    * Windows people has to watch MACOS videos as well to be able to create the framework

 What you will need to be able to automate with Appium:
        - Java JDK and JAVA_HOME set up
        - Android Studio Code for emulator(cellphone device) and Android SDK (software development kit)
        - Appium Server installed
        - Appium Inspector - nice to have
        - Appium Doctor - nice to have

Common Problems and How to fix them:
        - Windows: HAXM problem - virtualization : needs to be handled from BIOS setting
        - With both Windows and MacOS : setting up environmental variables
                * JAVA_HOME
                * ANDROID_HOME
        - Windows guys goes to environmental setup
        - MacOS guys create .zprofile document to set these variables

 How to mention appium or mobile testing in your resume
        - Skills part : Selenium, Java etc... Appium as a tool
        - Projects, if you need to mention it: automating mobile app for Android devices,
        - Saucelab as a cloud testing tool. Used saucelab servers to automate our test cases in the remote as a part of CI/CD pipeline

* Please use your github project link for the latest codes and pom.xml settings,
* The ones in the videos are changed.

0. WHY Mobile Testing important for your carrier and your company???????
        Mobile Devices in our life: Phones, TVs, watches, Car Devices, Tablets etc...
        Do you guys think that 5 years from now will there be any customer who will use regular desktop computer for their daily needs?

1. What is Mobile Testing?
        As a user when we are interacting with our mobile devices (phones), how do you open/use an application sucj as Amazon or Etsy, X
        -- etsy webapplication we open in our mobile device chrome browsers : webapp testing in mobile devices
        -- we download app from google store or apple store and install it  : Native App Testing
        -- testing mobile views on a browser: how my application will react in different screen sizes, testing your webapp with mobile view
            we can use an extension to test different mobile views for our application, this is not mobile testing, but can be considered as part of it

2. How is it done?
    Manual Mobile Testing: buy real mobile devices, no automation, no CI/CD process, expensive and risky

    Automation Way:
    Common tool used for testing is Appium: an API/Wrapper that communicates your code (Java, JS, Pyhton etc., because it uses Selenium as an API) to a mobile devices and acts like a SERVER in between
    You need a mobile device: When we are running our code locally, you create emulator (android), simulator (ios) -virtual
    we prepare our test for remote execution
    Companies pay subscription to Saucelab, BitBar, AppCenter, Browserstack for real mobile device that are on server

    We need to set up capabilities in our code to be able to send our test cases


3. How can we mention it in interviews/Resume?
       How did you do mobile testing in your company?
       Companies use a third party provider for mobile app builds and distribution (AppCenter)
       So these distributers also provide a testing environment(real mobile devices, appium servers)
       You write your using Java language and Appium Client (dependency) to write my tests
       When the code of application changes it initiates jenkins/github actions to run auto way smoke tests on the server.

       Resume: Appium client and server for mobile testing, Android Studio for Emulators, Using servers for remote testing on real/virtual iphone and android devices

4. Example tests structure in this repository

        Calculator, etsy : native apps that are run locally only
        SauceLab: first prepared locally and tested then executed on SauceLab server for remote execution

        We will test etsy chrome webapp locally.
        We will review how to execute tests on Saucelab android
        A new test, we will execute on iphone


**** We need to inspect elements locate them with appium inspector:
        1. CLI inspector (app itself)  write following caps and save it and start server with 'appium' command
        {
          "appium:deviceName": "Pixel 3",
          "appium:platformVersion": "10",
          "appium:automationName": "UiAutomator2",
          "platformName": "Android"
        }
        2. Inspector from browser start the appium with 'appium --allow-cors'




In order to allow appium to download necessary browser from web we need to start our appium with following command:

appium --allow-insecure chromedriver_autodownload
